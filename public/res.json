"descriptions":"The location makes it completely worthwhile. Tk1400 for a 2 person room with AC. Fan rooms were also available, The room was basic but clean, mosquito nets were provided over the beds. Attached bathroom had a western style. The rest house is actually within the limits of the archaeological site (Somapura Vihara) you are not restricted to visiting only within the opening hours. You will get up at sunrise and have the ruins to the morning mist which was really magical. The caretaker lady can provide a homecooked dinner and it is very tasty. Breakfast at the restaurant in the village.Note that you need to buy entrance tickets for the vihara/museum in addition to the room charge.","district":"Nawabganj, Bangladesh",
