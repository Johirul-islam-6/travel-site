We have included many Bangladeshi firsts - heated, salt water, and best of all, hanging, and partially transparent, infinity pool, a 119 feet tall mosaic mural, and a state-of-the-art heating and water filtration system for the whole building. To that we have added jaw-dropping features- glass floor on our Sky Pool Bar, a spectacular rooftop private dining room, and some mouth-watering culinary options, among them a live Teppanyaki show and a sushi bar. Six Seasons is an extraordinary hotel that offers every indulgence.
